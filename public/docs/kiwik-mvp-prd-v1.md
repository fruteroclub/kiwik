# PRD: kiwik MVP - Farcaster Native Builder Platform

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

- PRD: kiwik MVP - Farcaster Native Builder Platform
- Version: 1.0 MVP (Farcaster Mini App)

### 1.2 Product summary

kiwik MVP is a Farcaster Mini App that transforms builders into impact players through community-driven accountability and tokenized rewards. Built natively on Farcaster's decentralized social network, the platform leverages existing social graphs while adding structured progress tracking and Clanker-powered token launches on Base L2.

The Mini App creates a "degen games for regen outcomes" experience where builders document weekly progress through Farcaster casts, community members engage through native social features, and successful projects launch tokens via Clanker's API. This approach combines viral memetic energy with regenerative impact, proving that speculation can serve sustainability when properly aligned with community accountability systems.

## 6. Narrative

María is a talented developer from Mexico City with 500 Farcaster followers who struggles with accountability while building her fintech app solo. She discovers kiwik through a cast in the /builders channel and connects through SIWF authentication. María creates her project profile within the Mini App and commits to 12 weeks of progress casts. Every Monday, she sets weekly goals visible to her Farcaster network. Every Friday, she casts progress updates with embedded Mini App data showing metrics, screenshots, and honest reflections about challenges faced. Carlos, an active Farcaster degen with interests in regenerative outcomes, discovers María's journey in his feed and starts following her progress. He regularly likes and recasts her updates, providing feedback through Farcaster's native reply system. After 8 consistent weeks and hitting major milestones (50+ beta users, $500 MRR), María qualifies for Clanker token launch. The kiwik Mini App triggers Clanker's API to create $MARIA tokens on Base L2, with automatic allocation to Carlos and other supporters based on their documented engagement history. The token launch provides María with funding to focus full-time while Carlos benefits from early access to a project he supported from day one, proving that degen speculation can fuel regenerative building when aligned through community accountability.
